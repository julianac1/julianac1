ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Juliana Carvalho, I am a Brazilian with a degree in tourism living in Chile.
I have been working in the hospitality industry for years, due to Covid I was forced to leave my tourism career and "start over". 
For the last year I have been working in the wine industry in Chile and it has been a wonderful experience (if you have a chance please try it), however, I felt the need to start another career and IT was the chosen one. 
I am studying full-stack developer at CoderHouse a digital school in Argentina.
